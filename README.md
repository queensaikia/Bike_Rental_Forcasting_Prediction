# Bike_Rental_Forcasting_Prediction

The objective of the project is - 

-Using historical usage patterns and weather data, forecast(predict) bike rental demand (number of bike users (‘cnt’)) on hourly basis.

-Use the provided “Bikes Rental” data set to predict the bike demand (bike users count - 'cnt') using various best possible models (ML algorithms). 

-Also, report the model that performs best, fine-tune the same model using one of the model fine-tuning techniques, and report the best possible combination of hyperparameters for the selected model. 

-Lastly, use the selected model to make final predictions and compare the predicted values with the actual values.
